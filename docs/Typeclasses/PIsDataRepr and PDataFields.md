# `PIsDataRepr` & `PDataFields`

`PIsDataRepr` allows for easily constructing _and_ deconstructing `Constr` [`BuiltinData`/`Data`](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/plutonomicon/blob/main/builtin-data.md) values. It allows fully type safe matching on [`Data` encoded](./../Concepts/Data%20and%20Scott%20encoding.md) values, without embedding type information within the generated script - unlike PlutusTx. `PDataFields`, on top of that, allows for ergonomic field access.

> Aside: What's a `Constr` data value? Briefly, it's how Plutus Core encodes non-trivial ADTs into `Data`/`BuiltinData`. It's essentially a sum-of-products encoding. But you don't have to care too much about any of this. Essentially, whenever you have a custom non-trivial ADT (that isn't just an integer, bytestring, string/text, list, or assoc map) - and you want to represent it as a data encoded value - you should implement `PIsDataRepr` for it.

For example, `PScriptContext` - which is the Plutarch synonym to [`ScriptContext`](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/doc/haddock/plutus-ledger-api/html/Plutus-V1-Ledger-Contexts.html#t:ScriptContext) - has the necessary instances. This lets you easily keep track of its type, match on it, deconstruct it - you name it!

```hs
-- NOTE: REQUIRES GHC 9!
{-# LANGUAGE QualifiedDo #-}

import Plutarch.Prelude
import Plutarch.Api.V1.Contexts
import qualified Plutarch.Monadic as P

foo :: Term s (PScriptContext :--> PString)
foo = plam $ \ctx -> P.do
  purpose <- pmatch pfield @"purpose" # ctx
  case purpose of
    PMinting _ -> "It's minting!"
    PSpending _ -> "It's spending!"
    PRewarding _ -> "It's rewarding!"
    PCertifying _ -> "It's certifying!"
```

> Note: The above snippet uses GHC 9 features (`QualifiedDo`). Be sure to check out [Do syntax with `TermCont`](./../Usage/Do%20syntax%20with%20TermCont.md).

Of course, just like `ScriptContext` - `PScriptContext` is represented as a `Data` value in Plutus Core. Plutarch just lets you keep track of the _exact representation_ of it within the type system.

Here's how `PScriptContext` is defined:

```hs
newtype PScriptContext (s :: S)
  = PScriptContext
      ( Term
          s
          ( PDataRecord
              '[ "txInfo" ':= PTxInfo
               , "purpose" ':= PScriptPurpose
               ]
          )
      )
```

It's a constructor containing a [`PDataRecord`](./../Types/PDataSum%20and%20PDataRecord.md) term. It has 2 fields- `txInfo` and `purpose`.

First, we extract the `purpose` field using `pfield @"purpose"`:

```hs
pfield :: Term s (PScriptContext :--> PScriptPurpose)
```

> Note: When extracting several fields from the same variable, you should instead use `pletFields`. See: [Extracting fields](#all-about-extracting-fields)

> Aside: `pfield` is actually return type polymorhpic. It could've returned either `PAsData PScriptPurpose` and `PScriptPurpose`. In this case, GHC correctly infers that we actually want a `PScriptPurpose`, since `pmatch` doesn't work on `PAsData PScriptPurpose`!
>
> Sometimes GHC isn't so smart, and you're forced to provide an explicit type annotation. Or you can simply use `pfromData $ pfield ....`.

Now, we can `pmatch` on our `Term s PScriptPurpose` to extract the Haskell ADT (`PScriptPurpose s`) out of the Plutarch term:

```hs
pmatch :: Term s PScriptPurpose -> (PScriptPurpose s -> Term s PString) -> Term s PString
```

Now that we have `PScriptPurpose s`, we can just `case` match on it! `PScriptPurpose` is defined as:

```hs
data PScriptPurpose (s :: S)
  = PMinting (Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= PCurrencySymbol]))
  | PSpending (Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= PTxOutRef]))
  | PRewarding (Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= PStakingCredential]))
  | PCertifying (Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= PDCert]))
```

It's just a Plutarch sum type.

We're not really interested in the fields (the `PDataRecord` term), so we just match on the constructor with the familar `case`. Easy!

Let's pass in a `ScriptContext` as a `Data` value from Haskell to this Plutarch script and see if it works!

```hs
import Plutus.V1.Ledger.Api
import Plutus.V1.Ledger.Interval
import qualified PlutusTx

mockCtx :: ScriptContext
mockCtx =
  ScriptContext
    (TxInfo
      mempty
      mempty
      mempty
      mempty
      mempty
      mempty
      (interval (POSIXTime 1) (POSIXTime 2))
      mempty
      mempty
      ""
    )
    (Minting (CurrencySymbol ""))

> foo `evalWithArgsT` [PlutusTx.toData mockCtx]
Right (Program () (Version () 1 0 0) (Constant () (Some (ValueOf string "It's minting!"))))
```

> Aside: You can find the definition of `evalWithArgsT` at [Compiling and Running](../README.md#compiling-and-running).

## All about extracting fields

We caught a glimpse of field extraction in the example above, thanks to `pfield`. However, that barely touched the surface.

Once a type has a `PDataFields` instance, field extraction can be done with these 3 functions:

- `pletFields`
- `pfield`
- `getField` (when not using `OverloadedRecordDot` or [record dot preprocessor](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/record-dot-preprocessor))

Each has its own purpose. However, `pletFields` is arguably the most general purpose and most efficient. Whenever you need to extract several fields from the same variable, you should use `pletFields`:

```hs
-- NOTE: REQUIRES GHC 9!
{-# LANGUAGE QualifiedDo #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedRecordDot #-}

import Plutarch.Prelude
import Plutarch.Api.V1.Contexts
import qualified Plutarch.Monadic as P

foo :: Term s (PScriptContext :--> PUnit)
foo = plam $ \ctx' -> P.do
  ctx <- pletFields @["txInfo", "purpose"] ctx'
  let
    purpose = ctx.purpose
    txInfo = ctx.txInfo
  -- <use purpose and txInfo here>
  pconstant ()
```

> Note: The above snippet uses GHC 9 features (`QualifiedDo` and `OverloadedRecordDot`). Be sure to check out [Do syntax with `TermCont`](./../Usage/Do%20syntax%20with%20TermCont.md) and [alternatives to `OverloadedRecordDot`](./../Typeclasses/PIsDataRepr%20and%20PDataFields.md#alternatives-to-overloadedrecorddot).

In essence, `pletFields` takes in a type level list of the field names that you want to access and a continuation function that takes in an `HRec`. This `HRec` is essentially a collection of the bound fields. You don't have to worry too much about the details of `HRec`. This particular usage has type:

```hs
pletFields :: Term s PScriptContext
  -> (HRec
        (BoundTerms
           '[ "txInfo" ':= PTxInfo, "purpose" ':= PScriptPurpose]
           '[ 'Bind, 'Bind]
           s)
      -> Term s PUnit)
  -> Term s PUnit
```

You can then access the fields on this `HRec` using `OverloadedRecordDot`.

Next up is `pfield`. You should _only ever_ use this if you just want one field from a variable and no more. Its usage is simply `pfield @"fieldName" # variable`. You can, however, also use `pletFields` in this case (e.g. `pletFields @'["fieldName"] variable`). `pletFields` with a singular field has the same efficiency as `pfield`!

Finally, `getField` is merely there to supplement the lack of record dot syntax. See: [Alternative to `OverloadedRecordDot`](#alternatives-to-overloadedrecorddot).

> Note: An important thing to realize is that `pfield` and `getField` (or overloaded record dot on `HRec`) are _return type polymorphic_. They can return both `PAsData Foo` or `Foo` terms, depending on the surrounding context. This is very useful in the case of `pmatch`, as `pmatch` doesn't work on `PAsData` terms. So you can simply write `pmatch $ pfield ...` and `pfield` will correctly choose to _unwrap_ the `PAsData` term.

### Alternatives to `OverloadedRecordDot`

If `OverloadedRecordDot` is not available, you can also try using the [record dot preprocessor plugin](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/record-dot-preprocessor).

If you don't want to use either, you can simply use `getField`. In fact, `ctx.purpose` above just translates to `getField @"purpose" ctx`. Nothing magical there!

## All about constructing data values

We learned about type safe matching (through `PlutusType`) as well as type safe field access (through `PDataFields`) - how about construction? Since `PIsDataRepr` allows you to derive [`PlutusType`](./PlutusType,%20PCon,%20and%20PMatch.md), and `PlutusType` bestows the ability to not only _deconstruct_, but also **construct** values - you can do that just as easily!

Let's see how we could build a `PMinting` `PScriptPurpose` given a `PCurrencySymbol`:

```hs
import Plutarch.Prelude
import Plutarch.Api.V1

currSym :: Term s PCurrencySymbol
```

```hs
purpose :: Term s PScriptPurpose
purpose = pcon $ PMinting fields
  where
    currSymDat :: Term _ (PAsData PCurrencySymbol)
    currSymDat = pdata currSym
    fields :: Term _ (PDataRecord '[ "_0" ':= PCurrencySymbol ])
    fields = pdcons # currSymDat # pdnil
```

All the type annotations are here to help!

This is just like regular `pcon` usage you've [from `PlutusType`/`PCon`](./PlutusType,%20PCon,%20and%20PMatch.md). It takes in the Haskell ADT of your Plutarch type and gives back a Plutarch term.

What's more interesting, is the `fields` binding. Recall that `PMinting` is a constructor with one argument, that argument is a [`PDataRecord`](../Types/PDataSum%20and%20PDataRecord.md) term. In particular, we want: `Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= PCurrencySymbol ])`. It encodes the exact type, position, and name of the field. So, all we have to do is create a `PDataRecord` term!

Of course, we do that using `pdcons` - which is just the familiar `cons` specialized for `PDataRecord` terms.

```hs
pdcons :: forall label a l s. Term s (PAsData a :--> PDataRecord l :--> PDataRecord ((label ':= a) ': l))
```

It takes a `PAsData a` and adds that `a` to the `PDataRecord` heterogenous list. We feed it a `PAsData PCurrencySymbol` term and `pdnil` - the empty data record. That should give us:

```hs
pdcons # currSymDat # pdnil :: Term _ (PDataRecord '[ label ':= PCurrencySymbol ])
```

Cool! Wait, what's `label`? It's the field name associated with the field, in our case, we want the field name to be `_0` - because that's what the `PMinting` constructor wants. You can either specify the label with a type application or you can just have a type annotation for the binding (which is what we do here). Or you can let GHC try and match up the `label` with the surrounding environment!

Now that we have `fields`, we can use it with `PMinting` to build a `PScriptPurpose s` and feed it to `pcon` - we're done!

## Implementing `PIsDataRepr` and friends

Implementing these is rather simple with generic deriving and `PIsDataReprInstances`. All you need is a well formed type using `PDataRecord`. For example, suppose you wanted to implement `PIsDataRepr` for the Plutarch version of this Haskell type:

```hs
data Vehicle
  = FourWheeler Integer Integer Integer Integer
  | TwoWheeler Integer Integer
  | ImmovableBox
```

You'd declare the corresponding Plutarch type as:

```hs
import Plutarch.Prelude

data PVehicle (s :: S)
  = PFourWheeler (Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= PInteger, "_1" ':= PInteger, "_2" ':= PInteger, "_3" ':= PInteger]))
  | PTwoWheeler (Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= PInteger, "_1" ':= PInteger]))
  | PImmovableBox (Term s (PDataRecord '[]))
```

Each field type must also have a `PIsData` instance. We've fulfilled this criteria above as `PInteger` does indeed have a `PIsData` instance. However, think of `PBuiltinList`s, as an example. `PBuiltinList`'s `PIsData` instance is restricted to only `PAsData` elements.

```hs
instance PIsData a => PIsData (PBuiltinList (PAsData a))
```

Thus, you can use `PBuiltinList (PAsData PInteger)` as a field type, but not `PBuiltinList PInteger`.

> Note: The constructor ordering in `PVehicle` matters! If you used [`makeIsDataIndexed`](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/doc/haddock/plutus-tx/html/PlutusTx.html#v:makeIsDataIndexed) on `Vehicle` to assign an index to each constructor - the Plutarch type's constructors must follow the same indexing order.
>
> In this case, `PFourWheeler` is at the 0th index, `PTwoWheeler` is at the 1st index, and `PImmovableBox` is at the 3rd index. Thus, the corresponding `makeIsDataIndexed` usage should be:
>
> ```hs
> PlutusTx.makeIsDataIndexed ''FourWheeler [('FourWheeler,0),('TwoWheeler,1),('ImmovableBox,2)]
> ```
>
> Also see: [Isomorphism between Haskell ADTs and `PIsDataRepr`](./../Tricks/makeIsDataIndexed,%20Haskell%20ADTs,%20and%20PIsDataRepr.md)

And you'd simply derive `PIsDataRepr` using generics. However, you **must** also derive `PIsData` and `PlutusType` using `PIsDataReprInstances`. For single constructor data types, you should also derive `PDataFields`.

Furthermore, you can also derive the following typeclasses via `PIsDataReprInstances`:

- [`PEq`](./PEq%20and%20POrd.md)
- [`POrd`](./PEq%20and%20POrd.md)

Combine all that, and you have:

```hs
{-# LANGUAGE UndecidableInstances #-}

import qualified GHC.Generics as GHC
import Generics.SOP

import Plutarch.Prelude
import Plutarch.DataRepr (PIsDataReprInstances (PIsDataReprInstances))

data PVehicle (s :: S)
  = PFourWheeler (Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= PInteger, "_1" ':= PInteger, "_2" ':= PInteger, "_3" ':= PInteger]))
  | PTwoWheeler (Term s (PDataRecord '["_0" ':= PInteger, "_1" ':= PInteger]))
  | PImmovableBox (Term s (PDataRecord '[]))
  deriving stock (GHC.Generic)
  deriving anyclass (Generic, PIsDataRepr)
  deriving
    (PlutusType, PIsData)
    via PIsDataReprInstances PVehicle
```

> Note: You cannot derive `PIsDataRepr` for types that are represented using [Scott encoding](./../Concepts/Data%20and%20Scott%20encoding.md#scott-encoding). Your types must be well formed and should be using `PDataRecord` terms instead.

That's it! Now you can represent `PVehicle` as a `Data` value, as well as deconstruct and access its fields super ergonomically. Let's try it!

```hs
-- NOTE: REQUIRES GHC 9!
{-# LANGUAGE QualifiedDo #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedRecordDot #-}

import Plutarch.Prelude
import qualified Plutarch.Monadic as P

test :: Term s (PVehicle :--> PInteger)
test = plam $ \veh' -> P.do
  veh <- pmatch veh'
  case veh of
    PFourWheeler fwh' -> P.do
      fwh <- pletFields @'["_0", "_1", "_2", "_3"] fwh'
      fwh._0 + fwh._1 + fwh._2 + fwh._3
    PTwoWheeler twh' -> P.do
      twh <- pletFields @'["_0", "_1"] twh'
      twh._0 + twh._1
    PImmovableBox _ -> 0
```

> Note: The above snippet uses GHC 9 features (`QualifiedDo` and `OverloadedRecordDot`). Be sure to check out [Do syntax with `TermCont`](./../Usage/Do%20syntax%20with%20TermCont.md) and [alternatives to `OverloadedRecordDot`](./../Typeclasses/PIsDataRepr%20and%20PDataFields.md#alternatives-to-overloadedrecorddot).

What about types with singular constructors? It's quite similar to the sum type case. Here's how it looks:

```hs
{-# LANGUAGE UndecidableInstances #-}

import qualified GHC.Generics as GHC
import Generics.SOP

import Plutarch.Prelude
import Plutarch.DataRepr (
  PDataFields,
  PIsDataReprInstances (PIsDataReprInstances),
 )

newtype PFoo (s :: S) = PMkFoo (Term s (PDataRecord '["foo" ':= PByteString]))
  deriving stock (GHC.Generic)
  deriving anyclass (Generic, PIsDataRepr)
  deriving
    (PlutusType, PIsData, PDataFields)
    via PIsDataReprInstances PFoo
```

Just an extra `PDataFields` derivation compared to the sum type usage!
